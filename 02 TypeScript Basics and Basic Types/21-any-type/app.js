/*
  notes:
  The any type is the most flexible type you can assign in TypeScript. This type doesn't tell TypeScript anything.
  It basically means you can store any kind of value in there. So any is really flexible.
  And this can sound great at fist, but actually it's a big disadvantage and you absolutely want to avoid any whenever
  possible. Because any takes away basically all advantages TypeScript gives you. It gives you the same experience
  you have with vanilla JavaScript where you also have to any type on everything so to say. Any basically makes sure that
  the TypeScript compiler can't check anything,
